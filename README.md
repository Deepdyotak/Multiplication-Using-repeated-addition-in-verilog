# Multiplier by Repeated Addition (Datapath + Controlpath)

## üìå Project Overview
This project implements a **16-bit multiplier** using the method of **repeated addition**.  
The design is split into two modules:  
- **Datapath**: Handles registers, adder, counter, and muxes.  
- **Controlpath**: Finite State Machine (FSM) that controls the sequence of operations.  

This separation of datapath and controlpath mirrors the design style used in processors and makes the project scalable for N-bit implementations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Design Approach
- **Datapath Components**:
  - Register for multiplicand  
  - Register for multiplier  
  - Accumulator register  
  - Adder  
  - Counter & comparator

- **Controlpath (FSM States)**:
  - **LOAD**: Load inputs  
  - **ADD**: Add multiplicand to accumulator  
  - **DECREMENT**: Decrement counter  
  - **CHECK**: Check if multiplier reached 0 
  - **DONE**: Stop operation
